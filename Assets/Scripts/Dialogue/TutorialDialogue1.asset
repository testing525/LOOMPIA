  - Well, well... you are my very first visitor in this forgotten town!
  - Because of that, I shall grant you a special role.
  - From now on, you will be known as... the Wrapper.
  - 'Your duty is simple: clean up this mess and throw things where they belong.'

  - "But for now, no mistakes will count. You\u2019re still learning, after all..."
