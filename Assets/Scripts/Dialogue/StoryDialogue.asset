  - "Great job, little wrapper! Seems like you\u2019ve handled the fundamentals well."
  - "-Help! Someone please, I can\u2019t do this on my own!"
  - "Oh my\u2026 it sounds like someone\u2019s in trouble."
  - See over there? That folk looks exhausted. He must have been trying to clean
    up.
  - "Please! The trash keeps piling up and I\u2019m too tired to carry them to the
    bins\u2026 "
  - I can barely stand anymore!
  - "Hmm\u2026 This is where you come in, little one. Why don\u2019t you lend him
    a hand?"
  - "And don\u2019t worry, if you ever make a mistake"
  - "I\u2019ll grant you an extra chance"
  - "so long as you\u2019ve helped these people when they needed it."
  - "I should be going now, but I\u2019ll be watching. Good luck, little one"
  - "Please\u2026 help me pick up the trash and drop them into the right bins."
  - "Really? You\u2019ll help me? "
  - "Thank you\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without someone\u2019s support."
