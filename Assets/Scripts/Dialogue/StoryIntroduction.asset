  - Oh? What do we have here...
  - What made you go all the way here to stumble into this mysterious town?
  - None the less, you cannot leave this place anymore.
  - Why? Obviously because you are now part of the CURSE!
  - "Heh\u2026 You don\u2019t know what I mean, do you?"
  - Then listen closely, for this tale is older than your footsteps.
  - A long time ago... A magical creature lived in peace with the world. The forest
    grew strong, the rivers were clean, and all the animals lived together well.
  - One day, a group of tired humans arrived, asking the creature for help. Because
    it was kind, the creature helped them, teaching, protecting, and cleaning up
    after them.
  - "But as time passed, the humans became careless. They relied creature\u2019s
    kindness and didn't care about their own mess. What started as being thankful,
    turned into feeling they deserved help."
  - "At last, the creature\u2019s patience ran dry. It laid a curse upon the village:
    from then on, every human must solve a riddle before throwing trash into the
    proper bin. The riddles drew upon the wisdom of math, science, and literature,
    the very knowledge the humans had neglected. If one failed to answer, they would
    vanish, erased as punishment for ignorance."
  - But why had the humans grown so ignorant?
  - In the beginning, the creature not only cared for them but also provided answers
    to their every question. When they hungered, it taught them which fruits to eat;
    when they were lost, it guided their steps; when they wondered about the stars,
    it revealed their secrets.
  - Generation after generation, the humans forgot how to think critically. What
    once was a thriving people became a village of dependency, spoiled by endless
    generosity. Their minds dulled, their wisdom abandoned.
  - And so the curse was not born of malice alone, but of necessity, the only way
    the creature could force the humans to remember how to learn, how to struggle,
    and how to grow wise again.
  - Trapped within the remote village, the humans had no escape. Their only path
    forward was to relearn what they had forgotten to think, to grow wise, and to
    respect the world that once gave them everything.
