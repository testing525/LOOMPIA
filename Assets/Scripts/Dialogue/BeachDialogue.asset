  - "Ahh\u2026 look at it now. The beach looks alive again."
  - "Even without the rat\u2019s curse, it doesn\u2019t mean we should live carelessly."
  - Especially here, at the beach, every bit of trash can harm the sea and its creatures.
  - We must be mindful of what we leave behind.
  - "You\u2019ve done more than just clean, child. "
  - "You\u2019ve shown respect  to the sea, to the land, and to the life that depends
    on them."
  - Come visit me anytime by the shore. It eases my heart knowing there are still
    people who care.
